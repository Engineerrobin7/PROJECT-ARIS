```

**See `API_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions!**

### After Adding Keys, Try:
```
what's the weather in london
latest news
what's apple stock price
```

## 🎯 STEP 4: Try Different Interfaces

### Close current window, then try:

**1. JARVIS Advanced (Best Visual Experience)**
```bash
python jarvis_advanced.py
```

```bash
python jarvis_gui.py
```

**3. Text Mode (Most Reliable)**
```bash
python gui_text_mode.py
```

**4. Easy Menu (Choose Each Time)**
```bash
start_aris_easy.bat
